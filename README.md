# StrainAnalysis
This tool is used for analyzing strain for multilayer structures (like heterostructures, sandwich strucutres .eg). It analyzed and ouptut the vetical displacements of atoms for the layer you select, and the changes of bond lengths. 
It contains several useful functions. The first one is layer_sep, which is used to separate layers from the original structures. It returns separated layers as ASE atoms object in a list. To analyze strain, a flake for the selected layer will be generated by the flake_generator function.
