# StrainAnalysis
This tool is used for analyzing strain for multilayer structures (like heterostructures, and sandwich structures .eg). It analyzed and output the vertical displacements of atoms for the layer you select, and the changes of bond lengths.  
It contains several useful functions. The first one is layer_sep, which is used to separate layers from the original structures. It returns separated layers as ASE atoms object in a list. To analyze strain, a flake for the selected layer will be generated by the flake_generator function. It also has a mirror function to flip the structure in case you want to change the direction of displacements.  
The workflow is shown below:  
1. Use the layer_sep function to separate layers  
2. Generate flakes of the layers that you want to analyze
3. Use the prepare function to prepare the data
4. Visualize it.
